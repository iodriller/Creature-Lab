"""Qualification: combine task success, robustness, and backend portability into one
pass/fail result with a named primary blocker and a recommended next test.

Mirrors ``robustness.py``'s and ``evolve.py``'s pattern: this module never runs physics
itself. The caller injects a ``simulate`` (and optionally ``simulate_other_backend``)
function backed by whichever simulator/controller it likes, so qualification composes
the existing pieces (a baseline run, a robustness sweep, a cross-backend comparison)
instead of being a new isolated feature.
