"""Run long operations (simulate, robustness sweeps) off the GUI callback thread.

Viser dispatches each button click as a callback; if that callback blocks until an
entire physics episode (or a 50-trial robustness sweep) finishes, nothing else can
update in the meantime — no progress bar, no elapsed timer, no way to cancel. The fix
is the usual one: run the actual work in a background thread and let the caller poll
:meth:`EditorJobManager.status` from wherever it already runs a loop (see
``editor/live.py``'s main loop, which already polls for external file changes).

``EditorJobManager`` is deliberately independent of Viser and physics: the callable it
runs receives a :class:`ProgressReporter` and returns any picklable-ish result. That
keeps this module trivially unit-testable with a plain function and a timer.
