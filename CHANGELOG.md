# Changelog

All notable changes to Creature Lab are documented here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Experiment Autopsy and Failure Zoo:** `creature-lab autopsy` runs a selected-controller
  baseline, curated-controller counterfactual, task-aware perturbation trials, and optional
  backend comparison, then attributes the likely cause and emits JSON/Markdown/HTML plus a
  verified experiment pack. `failure list`/`failure export` provide six intentional teaching
  failures with expected causal categories.
- **Verified design-pack v2:** every saved run snapshots its exact controller and optional policy
  payload; packs hash every byte artifact and semantic JSON model; `verify-pack` detects missing,
  modified, unsafe, or incompatible content. Reports reproduce with the saved controller.
- **Executable showcase contracts:** `curated` is the Zoo/editor/demo first-run controller,
  unstable entries are challenges, and `zoo check-showcases` enforces score/no-fall thresholds.
- **Release readiness:** package metadata is 0.2.0, CI covers Linux/Windows/macOS and Python
  3.11/3.12, a dedicated Chromium job drives the real first-run editor, and tagged/manual release
  workflows build verified distributions without publishing automatically.

### Fixed

- **The humanoid loop now delivers a measurable result and returns to Design.** Fixed a PyBullet
  tree-order bug that silently mismatched names, joints, contacts, and traces on branched bodies;
  added per-motor force limits and gait center offsets; corrected humanoid mass and horizontal foot
  geometry; and packaged a PyBullet-tuned 12-DOF gait that moves about 0.42 m in 5 s without a
  fall. The editor now owns its Design/Motion/Test phase state and **Back to Design** pauses
  playback and restores the editable preview. Regression tests cover link identity, controller
  fields, body construction, phase restoration, and real-browser operation. `scaffold humanoid`
  and `generate_humanoid()` now default to that footed 12-DOF body; the footless 8-DOF diagnostic
  challenge remains available with `--dof 8`.
- Qualification portability requests can no longer be silently skipped, robustness evaluates
  profile-specific task success rather than just survival, and cancelled partial sweeps cannot
  pass as complete.
- Nonfinite artifact numbers, motors on fixed joints, duplicate controller targets, unsafe
  policy/run paths, XML DTD/entities, and inconsistent target radii are rejected at validation.
- Editor autosave now clears dirty state, pauses on external conflicts, detects deletion/content
  changes, reloads creature+task transactionally, composes nested rotations correctly, and owns
  background-job/browser-process teardown.
- Learned policies record and validate their observation/action ABI and creature/task hashes;
  target tasks observe their targets by default, root orientation/angular velocity are available,
  evaluation seeds match, and both backends can address the same hinge action surface.

### Added earlier in this development cycle

- **`creature-lab optimize`** (Grand Plan Phase 5, Tier 1): tunes a creature's gait (CMA-ES over
  each motor's amplitude/frequency/phase, body untouched) and saves the result as a portable
  `controller.json`, so the existing `evolve --strategy cmaes` search produces a reusable
  artifact instead of a throwaway evolved creature file. Measured on the zoo: quadruped
  0.57 → 1.97 (3.4x), hexapod 0.54 → 1.68 (3.1x), worm 0.93 → 1.51 (1.6x), tripod −0.68 → 0.94
  (its default gait was actually net-negative). `quadruped`/`hexapod`/`tripod`/`worm` each now
  ship this as an additive `controller.json` — `zoo run <name> --controller optimized` opts in,
  and `zoo list` shows which creatures have one; the baked-in default `creature.json` and
  baselines are untouched, so this is zero-risk to existing workflows. A later correction added a
  separately measured controller for the rebuilt 12-DOF humanoid; see the current Zoo docs.
- **`--controller posture`** (Grand Plan Phase 5, Tier 2): the first controller that senses and
  corrects instead of blindly playing a waveform — PD feedback on the previous frame's
  forward/backward lean (`creature_lab/controllers/posture.py`), the same "read prev_frame,
  correct this step" pattern `target_seek` already uses for steering. Measured: a static,
  uncorrected humanoid stance falls at ~2.0s under a 400N forward push; with `posture`'s default
  gains it survives forward and backward pushes up to 1200N and 8s standing with no push at all.
  Honest, measured limitation: every hip/knee/ankle hinge this codebase generates is sagittal-only
  (no side-to-side balance joint anywhere), so `posture` cannot correct sideways tipping — see
  `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. Available everywhere `--controller` is (CLI, editor Controller
  dropdown, `controller scaffold posture`, `ControllerSpec` with `type: "posture"`).
- **`creature-lab train`** (Grand Plan Phase 5, Tier 3, new optional `rl` extra): trains a real
  PPO policy over `CreatureEnv` (Stable-Baselines3) and saves it as a `policy`-type
  `ControllerSpec` — a `controller.json` + sibling `policy.zip` bundle that runs through
  `--controller <dir>/controller.json` exactly like every other controller type.
  `CreatureEnv` itself was not changed (its `step()`/`reset()` are an older, already-tested API
  real callers depend on); a new `CreatureGymEnv` (`creature_lab/rl/gym_env.py`) wraps it as a
  real `gymnasium.Env` instead — verified against gymnasium's own `check_env` compliance checker.
  `PolicyController` (`creature_lab/controllers/policy.py`) drives a loaded policy through the
  same `(t, prev_frame) -> targets` interface every controller uses, reusing `CreatureEnv`'s own
  observation/action translation rather than duplicating it. Measured, not assumed: a
  100,000-timestep training run on the quadruped example (~110s wall-clock) reached a mean
  episodic return 1.46-2.06x a random baseline on the same task (two independent runs). Scoped
  honestly: a working training loop with a measured positive result, not a promise of a polished
  walker. A later hand-tuned humanoid baseline demonstrates slow PyBullet stepping, but is not an
  RL result or a claim of general bipedal control.
- **Single active roadmap** ([`docs/GRAND_PLAN.md`](docs/GRAND_PLAN.md)): reconciles the three
  overlapping plan drafts (now archived under `docs/archive/some-plans/`) into one phased plan;
  `docs/ROADMAP.md` is reduced to a pointer and `IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026.md` is marked completed.
  The README now leads with a plain-language "what is this" and the design→move→test→improve loop.
- **Editor foundation, complete** (Grand Plan Phase 1): the build editor is reorganised from a
  vertical folder wall into **Design / Motion / Test** phases with a Project + History header.
  **undo/redo**, named **snapshots**, **reset to template**, **dirty-state** tracking, a
  **Basic/Advanced** mode, and a delete-impact preview so destructive edits (deleting a part with
  children, reloading over unsaved edits) confirm first. **Simulate and the robustness sweep now
  run as background jobs** (`creature_lab/editor/jobs.py`) with a live progress bar, elapsed time,
  and Cancel — `_simulate` and `robustness.run_trials` gained optional, backward-compatible
  `on_step`/`should_stop` hooks for this. A finished run loads into a **Playback** panel
  (`creature_lab/editor/playback.py`: play/pause, frame scrubber, step, restart) instead of
  auto-replaying inline. Non-structural edits (selecting a part or motor) no longer rebuild the
  whole 3D scene — only the affected overlay, or nothing, is touched.
- **Guided design + actionable diagnosis** (Grand Plan Phase 2, shipped subset): a first-run
  creature x goal onboarding picker; human-readable part labels and a part hierarchy tree
  (`creature_lab/editor/labels.py`); diagnosis cards tagged by severity, with an **Apply fix**
  button for patterns that have a safe, bounded, deterministic edit (reduce motor amplitude,
  reverse gait, apply a gait preset, widen stance); an integrated **Run History** panel
  (restore/replay saved runs, `runs.list_recent_runs`); and simplified **Quick/Standard/Thorough**
  robustness levels with a plain-language verdict (`robustness.plain_language_verdict`). Guided
  limb creation, a visual gait composer, a kinematic motion preview, and an explicit before/after
  comparison view remain deferred — see `docs/GRAND_PLAN.md` Phase 2.
- **Target-seeking controller** (Grand Plan Phase 3): `--controller target_seek` steers the
  existing CPG gait toward a task's target — body-frame heading-error steering, distance-based
  speed scaling, and a stop radius (`creature_lab/controllers/target_seek.py`), deterministic and
  verified with real-physics scenario tests on both PyBullet and MuJoCo. Works everywhere
  `--controller` already did (`run`, `build`, `bench`, `robustness`, `sim2sim`, `qualify` —
  `evolve` has no `--controller` flag; its `--mutate controller` is a different, unrelated
  thing) via the existing shared `_make_controller`/`_simulate` dispatch, plus a new
  **Controller** dropdown in the build editor's Test phase. Also fixes a pre-existing bug where an
  invalid `--controller` name exited silently with no error message (`typer.BadParameter` raised
  outside a parameter callback isn't printed by Click). New `target_not_approached` diagnosis
  pattern with an Apply-fix that switches to `target_seek`. Posture/balance control and
  per-actuator force/torque limits remain deferred — see `docs/GRAND_PLAN.md` Phase 3.
- **`qualify` command** (Grand Plan Phase 4): combines a baseline run, a robustness sweep, and
  (for `backend-portable`, or `--check-portability`) a cross-backend comparison into one
  pass/fail result with a named primary blocker and a recommended next test
  (`creature_lab/qualification.py`). Built-in profiles: `basic-locomotion`, `target-reach`,
  `push-recovery`, `backend-portable`. PyPI publishing, multi-OS CI, and a CLI command-module
  split remain out of scope for this pass — see `docs/GRAND_PLAN.md` Phase 4.
- **Audit pass: bug fixes, `ControllerSpec`, and `export-pack`** (Grand Plan Phase 4.5): an
  end-to-end re-verification of Phases 1–4 against the running code found and fixed four real
  bugs — `fell` used to depend on `task.reward.fall_penalty` being configured and is now
  orientation-based (`diagnosis.is_upright`/`first_fall_time`, reward-independent) whenever a
  creature is available; the editor's `target_seek`-without-a-target case surfaced a blank
  `"Failed: "` message instead of the real error; `qualify`'s `target-reach`/`push-recovery`
  profiles ran a full physics baseline before failing on an incompatible task instead of checking
  task/profile compatibility first; and `list_recent_runs` fully pydantic-validated every trace
  (including every recorded frame) just to list a handful of summary rows. Also shipped the two
  highest-value Phase 3/4 deferred items: **`ControllerSpec`**, a fourth portable JSON artifact
  (`creature_lab/schema/controller.py`, `creature_lab/controllers/factory.py`) — `--controller`
  now accepts a `controller.json` path anywhere it accepted a built-in name, a new `controller
  scaffold`/`extract`/`validate` command group authors and checks them, and `TraceMeta.controller`
  records which controller produced a run — and **`creature-lab export-pack`**
  (`creature_lab/exporting.py`), which bundles a run's creature/task/controller/trace plus a
  reproducibility-hash `manifest.json` into one portable, shareable directory. Also added a
  **Qualify** panel to the build editor's Test phase, and a steerability warning when `target_seek`
  is selected on a creature with no `l`/`r`-suffixed motored joint. See `docs/GRAND_PLAN.md`
  Phase 4.5.

Earlier phases from [`docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026.md`](docs/IMPROVEMENT_PLAN_2026.md), building on
the complete MVP:

- **Self-contained HTML reports** (Phase R): `report --html` writes a single offline run
  card (score breakdown, signal sparklines, root-path plot, optional embedded GIF,
  diagnosis, and a reproducibility block with a runnable reproduce command).
  `compare --html` writes a before/after comparison report. `gallery build --zoo` now also
  emits `index.html` with baseline-vs-current score coloring per creature.
- **Terrain library** (Phase 1): `TaskSpec.terrain.type` gains `slope`, `steps`, `gaps`, and
  `rough`, built from a shared, deterministic heightfield (`creature_lab/terrain.py`) that
  both the PyBullet and MuJoCo backends simulate with the same shape. Three new quadruped
  zoo tasks: `slope_climb`, `step_over`, `gap_cross`.
- **Robustness and sim2sim analysis** (Phase 2): `robustness <run> --trials N` re-simulates
  under small seeded mass/friction perturbations and reports the score distribution and
  fail rate. `sim2sim <run>` runs the same creature/task on PyBullet and MuJoCo and reports
  the score gap and trajectory divergence. Both support `--save` to write a reportable run.
- **Quality-diversity gallery** (Phase 3): `evolve --strategy map_elites` now persists each
  filled cell's `CreatureSpec`. `archive show <run> --html` renders a scored heatmap (with
  optional per-cell replay GIFs via `--task`); `archive export --cell row,col` pulls one
  elite out as a standalone spec.
- **Sharpened LLM design loop** (Phase 4): `ask`'s prompt (and the offline policy's
  `Observation`) now includes the current diagnosis, so proposals can target a detected
  failure pattern instead of guessing blind. New `evolve --strategy llm` mutation operator
  reuses the offline, no-API-key `RandomToolPolicy` through the validated tool layer;
  per-attempt rationale is saved into `lineage.json`.
- **MuJoCo baselines** (Phase 5): every packaged zoo creature/task pair now has a
  real, measured MuJoCo baseline (`baselines/<task>.mujoco.json`) alongside the existing
  PyBullet one; `zoo_baseline(..., backend=...)` and `bench --backend mujoco --zoo` compare
  against the correct one (previously `bench` always compared against the PyBullet
  baseline, even when benchmarking MuJoCo — this silently made the pass/fail threshold
  wrong for every non-default-backend benchmark run).

- **Terrain fidelity in viewer/export/report**: `view`, `compare`, `export`, and the run
  report's embedded GIF now draw the *actual* terrain shape (a `trimesh` heightfield mesh
  in the Viser viewer, a PyBullet heightfield body in `render_trace`) instead of always a
  flat floor. Found in a post-implementation review: the terrain physics was correct but
  every visualization still showed a flat plane, so a `slope_climb`/`gap_cross` replay
  misleadingly showed the creature floating above or sinking into nothing.
- **Terrain surfaced in reports/inspect**: `creature_lab/terrain.describe_terrain()` gives
  a one-line summary (e.g. `"slope (angle=0.2 rad, friction=1)"`), now shown by `inspect`
  and included in every run report (Markdown, HTML, and JSON) — previously a report gave
  no indication of which terrain a run used.
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: a living list of latent gaps and deliberate limitations found in
  review, so findings have a home instead of being re-discovered or lost.
- **Self-contained archive heatmaps**: `archive show --html --task` now embeds per-cell
  replay GIFs as `data:` URIs (matching the run report), instead of writing them to a
  sibling directory the page depends on and breaks if moved.
- **CI now wheel-tests the package**: builds the wheel, installs it into a fresh venv, and
  runs `doctor` + `zoo run` against the installed package on every push/PR — the same check
  Phase 5 previously only ran by hand.
- `validate_episode_inputs` warns when a task's **target** lies outside the generated
  terrain's finite extent on non-flat terrain — closes part of the "non-flat terrain has a
  finite 6.4 m extent" known issue (the target-based case; open-ended locomotion tasks
  can't be checked this way, since expected travel isn't derivable from the spec alone).
- `terrain.py` now asserts its default grid is square at import time, since the
  PyBullet/MuJoCo axis convention was only verified empirically for `rows == cols`.

### Fixed

- **A successful onboarding run could still score negative, and the humanoid fell over
  instantly.** Measured every onboarding creature x goal x controller combination through real
  physics (not assumed) and found two separate real bugs:
  - **Reward miscalibration**: `reach_target`'s `energy_penalty` was ~10x too large relative to
    the actual energy an open-loop gait accumulates in a few seconds (measured: ~100-280 raw
    units), so a run that reached 83% of the way to the target still scored **-0.10**.
    `stability_hold` was built only from penalties, so its best possible score was 0 — a creature
    that stayed upright the whole episode could never score positive. Fixed by lowering the
    onboarding `energy_penalty` (re-measured empirically for every preset creature) and adding a
    new **`RewardSpec.survival`** field (`creature_lab/scoring.py`) — the positive mirror of
    `fall_penalty` — so "stay balanced" tasks can actually be won. The Result headline now also
    leads with concrete progress ("Moved 0.83 m closer to the target; stayed upright") with the
    raw score shown below it, not as the sole, unexplained headline.
  - **The humanoid**: a systematic stability sweep found that *any* nonzero open-loop sinusoid
    gait topples this biped in 0.8-3.3s regardless of stance width or leg length — only a fully
    static stance passively balances (a fundamental limitation of open-loop control on a biped,
    not a tunable parameter; real walking needs a balance controller, which doesn't exist yet).
    The onboarding humanoid now defaults to `dof=12` (feet/hands) and `amplitude=0` (a stable
    stance rather than a gait that reliably falls), and picking Humanoid in onboarding
    auto-switches the Goal to **Stay balanced** with an explanatory note, since that's the one
    goal it can actually achieve (measured: stays upright the full episode, score 1.000).
  See `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` for the full measurement writeup.
- **The build editor's first run was unusable** (found by driving the real editor in a headless
  browser, which is the only thing that catches client-side rendering bugs): the Welcome
  onboarding was a Viser modal, and a Viser/Mantine modal traps focus onto its first control —
  which **auto-opened the Creature dropdown right on top of the Start/Skip buttons**. A
  first-time user could not click Start or Skip (clicking either hit a dropdown option), and the
  modal overlay blocked every other click too, so tabs and Simulate appeared dead — "can't go
  back to Design / Test doesn't work / it simply doesn't work." Onboarding is now an inline
  **Get started** panel at the top of the side panel (no focus trap, no auto-open); everything
  below it — tabs, controllers, Simulate — works normally.
- **The Test phase showed conflicting info after a run.** After Simulate, changing the controller,
  task, or body left the old score/breakdown/diagnosis showing next to a status describing a
  different configuration (e.g. a healthy sinusoid score beside a "target_seek needs a target"
  error). A run's result is now tagged with the `(creature, task, controller)` that produced it
  and cleared the moment the live config drifts from it, so the panel never shows a stale result.
- Added `scripts/browser_smoke.py` (new optional `browser` extra) — a headless-browser smoke
  test that drives the editor's first-run journey and asserts it stays usable and error-free.
  This is the class of test that catches the two bugs above; the fake-GUI unit tests
  structurally cannot (see `docs/BUILD_EDITOR.md`).
- **The build editor could fail to render at all** (a blank white page, found via a real
  headless-browser check, not just a server-boots check): the Test phase's Run History dropdown
  passed Viser/Mantine a list of option labels without deduplicating them. Two saved runs with
  the same creature, task, score, and "time ago" bucket (rounded to whole seconds/minutes/tenths
  of an hour) produce an identical label — trivial to hit just by re-running the same example
  twice — and Mantine's underlying `Select` component throws on a duplicate option value, which
  crashed the *entire* React app, not just the dropdown. `BuildControls._unique_run_history_labels`
  now disambiguates colliding labels with the run id, only when they actually collide.
- `bench --zoo --backend mujoco` compared results against the PyBullet baseline (a much
  higher score than nearly every gait achieves on MuJoCo), so the pass/fail threshold was
  meaningless for any backend other than the default.
- `evolve --strategy map_elites` discarded each archived cell's `CreatureSpec`, saving only
  its score/features — `archive export` had nothing to export until this was fixed.

## [0.1.0]

Initial MVP: schemas, CLI, PyBullet and MuJoCo backends, Viser replay, local evolution
(hill-climb/genetic/MAP-Elites/CMA-ES), offline/online `ask` design loop, the Creature Zoo,
diagnosis, URDF/MJCF export, and reports. See [`docs/archive/`](docs/archive/) for the
phase-by-phase history.
