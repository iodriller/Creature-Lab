# Failure Lab: Three Reproducible Robotics Lessons

Creature Lab's first post-release specialization is education: short experiments where the goal
is not merely to make something move, but to form a hypothesis, isolate one variable, and preserve
evidence another person can rerun.

## Lesson 1: Body Or Controller?

```bash
creature-lab failure export frozen-gait --out outputs/lesson-1
cd outputs/lesson-1
creature-lab autopsy creature.json --task task.json --controller controller.json
```

Before opening the report, predict the cause. Compare the failed controller with the curated
counterfactual, change only motor amplitude, and rerun. Explain why changing the body first would
be a weaker experiment.

## Lesson 2: Nominal Success Is Not Robustness

Export `overdriven-gait` or `ice-rink-task`. Find a configuration that succeeds once, then run
qualification. Record nominal score, task success rate under perturbations, and which single
change improves the failure rate without simply lowering the task threshold.

```bash
creature-lab qualify creature.json --task task.json --profile basic-locomotion
```

## Lesson 3: Portable Artifact, Different Physics

Run one experiment on both backends and distinguish two claims:

- Structural portability: both backends can load the same artifacts.
- Behavioral portability: scores and task outcomes agree within a declared threshold.

```bash
creature-lab autopsy creature.json --task task.json \
  --controller controller.json --check-portability
```

Use the generated pack as the submission. A complete submission includes the hypothesis, the
single variable changed, the autopsy report, and `verify-pack` output.

## Instructor Regression Check

```bash
creature-lab zoo check-showcases
creature-lab failure list
```

Failure cases declare expected causal categories. They can become automated curriculum tests as
attribution grows more precise; until then, keep the expected file beside each exported exercise
and discuss disagreements as evidence, not as a score to game.
