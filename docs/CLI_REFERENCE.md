# CLI Reference

Use `uv run creature-lab --help` for exact options. This page groups commands by workflow.

## Start Here

```bash
python scripts/start.py
uv run creature-lab demo --open-browser
uv run creature-lab build
uv run creature-lab zoo list
uv run creature-lab zoo run quadruped
uv run creature-lab zoo check-showcases
uv run creature-lab report latest
```

- `demo` runs a built-in creature in the live browser viewer.
- `build` opens the browser setup screen for visual creature editing and simulation.
- `zoo list` distinguishes measured showcases from intentionally difficult challenges.
- `zoo run <name>` uses the measured `curated` controller by default and saves its exact
  controller snapshot. Use `--controller sinusoid` for the raw teaching baseline.
- `zoo check-showcases` runs every promoted example against score and fall thresholds.
- `report latest` summarizes the last saved run.

## Launcher Scripts

The root launcher is the recommended first command from a repo checkout:

```powershell
.\run.bat
```

```bash
./run.command  # macOS
./run.sh       # Linux
```

Use `.\run.ps1` from PowerShell. The lower-level launcher below exposes
editor-specific options after the environment is installed:

```bash
python scripts/start.py
```

Useful options:

| Option | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `--once` | Run one pass, save the trace, and exit. |
| `--no-open-browser` | Print the viewer URL without opening a browser tab. |
| `--creature worm` | Run a different packaged demo creature. |
| `--creature-path path/to/creature.json` | Run a local CreatureSpec. |
| `--task path/to/task.json` | Override the default task. |
| `--port 8090` | Use a different Viser port. |
| `--full` | Install all optional extras before launching. |
| `--skip-sync` | Reuse the current environment. |
| `--dry-run` | Print commands without running them. |

```

- `build` edits a CreatureSpec (or URDF) in a Viser browser UI: tune it, drag task targets in
  3D, read live metrics, a
  robustness sweep, and a qualification pass/fail after Simulate, then save. `--project <dir>`
  binds it to `creature.json`/`task.json` in that directory, autosaving edits and detecting
  external changes with a Reload prompt (see `docs/BUILD_EDITOR.md`).
- `run` simulates one creature/task pair. `--controller` chooses `sinusoid` (default),
  `cpg` (coupled-oscillator gait), `target_seek` (steers the gait toward `task.target` —
  needs a task with one), `posture` (closed-loop PD balance — corrects forward/backward
  lean only, does not walk toward a goal; see Known Issues for why it can't correct
  sideways lean), or a path to a `controller.json` (a portable `ControllerSpec` — see
  `controller` below, or `train`'s output for a `policy`-type one); also available on
  `build`/`bench`/`robustness`/`sim2sim`/`qualify` — **not** `evolve`, see below. The editor
  also offers `curated`, which selects a measured packaged gait or safe feedback fallback.
- `evolve` searches for a better body/gait via `--mutate body,controller` (mutating the body's
  own `MotorSpec` amplitude/frequency/phase — unrelated to the `--controller` flag above; evolve
  always simulates with the default open-loop `sinusoid` policy, it has no `--controller` option).
  `--strategy llm` uses the validated agent tool layer (offline by default) as the mutation
  operator instead of the structural body/controller mutators; each attempt's rationale is saved
  into `lineage.json` (`creature-lab lineage <run>` shows it).
- `optimize` tunes a creature's gait (CMA-ES over each motor's amplitude/frequency/phase, body
  untouched — the same search `evolve --strategy cmaes` runs) and saves the result as a portable
  `controller.json` instead of a new creature file. The un-tuned default gait leaves real
  performance on the table: a quadruped example went from score 0.24 to 0.70 (2.9x) in 80
  evaluations. Every zoo locomotion creature ships a pre-optimized `controller.json` — see
  `zoo run --controller optimized` below.
- `train` trains a real PPO policy (Stable-Baselines3 over `CreatureEnv`) and saves it as a
  `controller.json` + `policy.zip` bundle (`--controller <dir>/controller.json` runs it — a
  `policy`-type `ControllerSpec` always needs its sibling `policy.zip`, so move the whole
  directory together, not just the JSON). Needs the optional `rl` extra
  (`uv sync --extra rl` — gymnasium, Stable-Baselines3, torch). Policy payloads may contain
  pickle-based data, so load only policies you trust. New bundles record observation/action ABI
  and creature/task hashes and reject incompatible dimensions. Prints the trained policy's
  mean return against a random baseline on the same task, measured, not assumed — a 100k-timestep
  run on the quadruped example reaches 1.5-2x the random baseline in under 2 minutes. Scoped
  honestly: a working, measured training loop, not a promise of a polished walker — real bipedal
  walking is a research problem. The packaged 12-DOF humanoid is a separate hand-tuned,
  PyBullet-specific open-loop baseline; it is not evidence that PPO learned a humanoid gait.
- `ask` applies validated design edits, offline or with an optional LLM provider. Every
  proposal now sees the current diagnosis (failure patterns + suggestions) alongside the
  score, so an online LLM can target the actual detected problem instead of guessing blind.
- `qualify` combines a baseline run, a task-aware robustness sweep, and (for the `backend-portable`
  profile) a cross-backend comparison into one pass/fail result with a named primary blocker
  and a recommended next test. Built-in profiles: `basic-locomotion`, `target-reach`,
  `push-recovery`, `backend-portable`; `target-reach` and `push-recovery` fail fast with a
  clear "Task setup" check if the task doesn't have what the profile needs (a target, or a
  damage/impulse event) rather than running physics first. `--json` prints a machine-readable
  result. Also available as a **Qualify** panel in `creature-lab build`'s Test phase (see
  `docs/BUILD_EDITOR.md`).
- `autopsy` runs the selected-controller baseline, a curated-controller counterfactual,
  task-aware perturbations, optional backend comparison, causal attribution, and emits
  HTML/Markdown/JSON plus a verified pack.
- `failure list` and `failure export <id>` expose intentionally broken experiments with an
  expected diagnosis for teaching and regression work.
- `controller scaffold <cpg|target_seek|posture>` writes a starter `controller.json` with that
  controller's own built-in defaults. `controller extract <creature.json>` migrates a
  creature's own gait (`MotorSpec` amplitude/frequency/phase/offset) into an explicit, portable
  sinusoid `controller.json` — the same thing `--controller sinusoid` already does implicitly,
  now a shareable file. `controller validate <controller.json> --creature <creature.json>
  [--task <task.json>]` checks a controller.json against a specific creature/task (for a
  sinusoid spec, warns if none of its joint ids match the creature's motors — such a spec would
  silently drive nothing). Any `controller.json` can then be passed to `--controller` above.

## Replay And Debug

```bash
uv run creature-lab replay runs/<run-id>
uv run creature-lab inspect runs/<run-id>
uv run creature-lab diagnose runs/<run-id>
uv run creature-lab report latest --out report.md
uv run creature-lab report latest --html report.html
uv run creature-lab view runs/<run-id> --open-browser
uv run creature-lab export latest --gif creature.gif
uv run creature-lab export-pack latest --out outputs/my_design_pack
uv run creature-lab verify-pack outputs/my_design_pack
```

- `replay` prints a short trace summary.
- `inspect` prints metadata, hashes, score components, contacts, warnings, and run metrics
  (including which controller produced the run, if known).
- `diagnose` explains likely failure patterns and suggested edits.
- `report` writes a Markdown or JSON summary with score, diagnostics, artifacts, and a
  reproducibility block. `--html` also writes a self-contained HTML run card (score
  breakdown, signal sparklines, root-path plot, and an optional embedded GIF preview).
- `view` replays recorded poses in the browser viewer.
- `export` renders a recorded trace to GIF or MP4.
- `export-pack` bundles a run into one portable, shareable directory: `creature.json`,
  `task.json` (if any), `controller.json`, `trace.json`, and a `manifest.json` with
  reproducibility hashes — no dependency on `runs/` or anything else on the machine that
  produced it. Current runs snapshot the exact controller when they are saved; learned-policy
  packs copy the model payload as well. Older runs fall back with an explicit warning rather
  than claiming exact reproduction. `verify-pack` checks all byte/semantic hashes, schemas,
  bundle-contained paths, and policy presence before use. Defaults to `outputs/<run_id>_pack`
  when `--out` is omitted. `--json` prints the manifest.

Most run-reading commands accept either `runs/<run-id>`, a `trace.json` path, a bare run id
under `runs/`, or `latest`.

## Advanced

```bash
uv run creature-lab scaffold quadruped --out quad.json
uv run creature-lab scaffold humanoid --out humanoid.json  # footed 12-DOF default
uv run creature-lab scaffold humanoid --dof 8 --out footless-challenge.json
uv run creature-lab mirror-limb half_creature.json --side left --out symmetric.json
uv run creature-lab export-urdf quad.json --out quad.urdf
uv run creature-lab export-mjcf quad.json --out quad.xml
uv run creature-lab import-urdf robot.urdf --out robot.json
uv run creature-lab compare runs/<a> runs/<b>
uv run creature-lab compare runs/<a> runs/<b> --html diff.html
uv run creature-lab plot runs/<run-id> --metric joint_energy --out energy.png
uv run creature-lab bench --zoo --task crawl_forward --attempts 3 --out runs/bench.json
uv run creature-lab schema creature --out docs/schemas/creature.schema.json
uv run creature-lab gallery build --zoo --out docs/assets/zoo --no-media
uv run creature-lab lineage runs/<evolve-run-id>
uv run creature-lab archive show runs/<map-elites-run-id> --html archive.html
uv run creature-lab archive export runs/<map-elites-run-id> --cell 3,2 --out elite.json
uv run creature-lab robustness runs/<run-id> --trials 10
uv run creature-lab sim2sim runs/<run-id>
uv run creature-lab doctor
uv run creature-lab version
```

These commands are useful for authoring, interoperability, run comparison, diagnostics, and
environment checks. They are intentionally outside the first-run path.

- `archive show` (only useful after `evolve --strategy map_elites`) prints the filled
  behaviour cells as a table, or `--html` renders a scored heatmap; add `--task` to embed a
  replay GIF per cell. `archive export --cell row,col` pulls one elite out as a standalone,
  editable `CreatureSpec` JSON.
- `robustness` re-simulates a creature/task under small seeded mass/friction perturbations
  and reports the score mean/std/fail-rate — a wide spread means the gait only works for the
  exact recorded parameters. Add `--save` to write a reportable run (`report <dir>` then
  shows a Robustness section). The same engine is available as a **Robustness** panel inside
  `creature-lab build` (see `docs/BUILD_EDITOR.md`), run directly against the in-editor
  creature without saving a run first.
- `sim2sim` runs the same creature/task on both PyBullet and MuJoCo and reports the score gap
  and mean root-position divergence — a concrete measure of the "specs are portable, physics
  is backend-dependent" contract. Add `--save` for a reportable run.

## Machine-Readable Output

Use `--json` on `run`, `evolve`, `optimize`, `train`, `ask`, `inspect`, `diagnose`, `report`,
`zoo list`, `zoo run`, `robustness`, `sim2sim`, `qualify`, and `export-pack` when another tool
needs structured output instead of Rich tables.
